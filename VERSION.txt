mvp-iter2.2.121-ultra-parallax-stability
- Fix: Ultra "wavy / glass" distortion from height-parallax at mid/far distances.
  Parallax UV displacement is now gated by screen-space UV footprint (disables when many tiles on screen)
  and clamped to a fraction of the pixel footprint, preserving rigid tile geometry.
- Build stamp updated + cache-bust query params updated (iter2_2_121_0)
