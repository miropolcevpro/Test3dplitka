mvp-iter2.2.120-ultra-blackfix-v2
- Fix: Ultra black texture on some palettes/GPUs (Level B 3-tap now samples roughness/AO via robust grayscale helper + PBR safety fallback)
- Fix: cache-bust query params in index.html updated (iter2_2_120_0) so browser doesn't stick to old build
- Build stamp shown in footer via state.build.version
